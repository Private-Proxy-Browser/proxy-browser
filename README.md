*Key Uses of a Proxy Browser:*

ðŸ‘‰ Privacy Protection: Hides your IP address to keep browsing activity more anonymous.

ðŸ‘‰ Access Restricted Content: Helps users access websites or services that are blocked in their country, school, or workplace.

ðŸ‘‰ Bypass Censorship: Useful in regions with internet censorship to reach otherwise inaccessible websites.

ðŸ‘‰ Security on Public Wi-Fi: Adds a layer of protection by routing your traffic through a remote server.

About 3.8 billion people are online every day. Not all data is available to all people around the world. For example, a show on Netflix in one country may not be available in another country. This is due to restrictions and copyrights imposed by the government of the respective country. Web proxy is the easiest way to access all restricted content without having to install any kind of software.

A web proxy allows you to browse the web anonymously and unblock your favorite websites without installing software, like a VPN. All your traffic is encrypted while browsing to make sure you stay anonymous.

A Web Proxy has its own IP address, which acts as the intermediary between the user and the internet. Once the user requests information online, the request is routed via a web proxy, the web proxy retrieves the information from the targeted website, then sends it to the user. This way the user's local IP address is masked.
